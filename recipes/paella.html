    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Paella can contain any combination of meat and seafood (such as chicken, chorizo, rabbit, shrimp, shellfish, eel,
        or
        pork) and veggies (like onions, bell peppers, peas, and beans). All types of paella contain rice seasoned with
        saffron,
        a mellow spice that gives the dish its signature golden hue.</p>

        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 (4 pound) ehole chicken, cut into6 pieces</li>
        <li>1/2 (2 pound) rabbit, cleaned and cut into pieces</li>
        <li>1 head garlic, cloves seperated and peeled</li>

        <li>1/2(10 ounce) package frozen green peas</li>
        <li>1/2(10 ounce) package frozen green beans</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon mild paprika, or to taste</li>
        <li>6 cups water, or as needed</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch saffron threads, or to taste</li>

        <li>3 cups short-grain white rice,or as needed</li>


    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a paella pan over medium-high heat, and coat with olive oil. Add chicken, rabbit, and garlic; cook and
            stir until
            nicely browned. Move the browned meat to the sides of the pan, and add tomato, butter beans, peas, and green
            beans.
            Season with paprika, and mix well.</li>
        <li>Fill the paella pan almost to the top with water, measuring the water as you add it so you can determine the
            amount of
            rice to add later. Bring to a boil. Simmer for about 1 hour to make a nice broth.
        </li>
        <li>
            Season with a generous amount of salt, just enough saffron for a yellow color, thyme, and rosemary. Stir in
            half as much
            rice as the amount of water added to the pan. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer until all of the liquid
            has been
            absorbed, about 20 minutes.
        </li>


    </ol>
